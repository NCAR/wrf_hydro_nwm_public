## Description
This is the code repository for [WRF-Hydro®](https://ral.ucar.edu/projects/wrf_hydro).

WRF-Hydro is a community modeling system and framework for hydrologic modeling and model coupling.  In 2016 a configuration of WRF-Hydro was implemented as the [National Water Model](http://water.noaa.gov/about/nwm) (NWM) for the continental United States.

## Documentation
Documentation is available at [wrf-hydro.readthedocs.io](https://wrf-hydro.readthedocs.io) with further guides available at our [project website](https://ral.ucar.edu/projects/wrf_hydro/technical-description-user-guide). For getting started see the [dependencies](https://wrf-hydro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model-code-config.html#requirements) and [build instructions](https://wrf-hydro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model-code-config.html#cmake-build) in the documentation.
