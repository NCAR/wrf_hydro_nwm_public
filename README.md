## Description
This is the code repository for [WRF-Hydro®](https://ral.ucar.edu/projects/wrf_hydro).

WRF-Hydro is a community modeling system and framework for hydrologic modeling and model coupling.  In 2016 a configuration of WRF-Hydro was implemented as the [National Water Model](http://water.noaa.gov/about/nwm) (NWM) for the continental United States.
