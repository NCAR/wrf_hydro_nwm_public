A1. Standalone (Uncoupled) WRF-Hydro Test Case User Guide
---------------------------------------------------------

Purpose
^^^^^^^

This example test case is meant to orient you to running the
WRF-Hydro modelling system using prepared geographical inputs, and
prepared forcing data for a specific region (domain). We provide
baseline instructions to test that your WRF-Hydro executable was
compiled correctly and is able to run on your system. Please see the
Readme.txt file provided with the test case for specific file
descriptions and a regional description.

This test case provides example namelists and prepared geographical
input files for three routing configurations. While the step-by-step
walkthrough instructions here guide you through running the Gridded
configuration we suggest that you explore the other routing
configurations and related namelists for reference.

For further information on the WRF-Hydro modeling system and possible
training opportunities, please visit https://ral.ucar.edu/projects/wrf_hydro.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- WRF-Hydro source code:
   - https://github.com/NCAR/wrf_hydro_nwm_public.git
   - ``git clone`` into directory where you will be running this case

- An official WRF-Hydro example test case:
   -  Download from: https://ral.ucar.edu/projects/wrf_hydro/testcases
   -  or from release assets at: https://github.com/NCAR/wrf_hydro_nwm_public/releases

- All system libraries needed by the WRF-Hydro modeling system can be found
  in the :ref:`build instructions <section-2.8>`.

Step-by-step walkthrough
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Directory structure setup**:

We will organize all files and folders under a common top-level
directory to simplify commands in this walkthrough. All paths mentioned
in this walkthrough will be relative to this top-level directory. For
example, :file:`/home/user/project_directory/example_case/` will be referred to
as :file:`example_case/`.

#. Open a terminal window

#. Create a top-level directory that will hold all subdirectories and
   files used for this walkthrough. Hereafter referred to as the
   ‘project directory’.

#. Copy the uncompressed WRF-Hydro source code into the project
   directory created in step 2.

#. Copy the example case directory into
   the project directory as well.

#. An example of your project directory structure using the Croton, NY
   example test case would look like the following:

.. code-block:: console

   project_directory/
     ├──wrf_hydro_nwm_public/
     |      ├──src/
     |
     ├──example_case/
             ├──Gridded_no_lakes/
             ├──Gridded/
             ├──NWM/
             ├──Reach/
             ├──ReachLakes/
             ├──FORCING/
             ├──supplemental/
             ├──Readme.txt

Compiling the Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have not built WRF-Hydro before on your current system, please follow the
instructions in the :ref:`build instructions <section-2.8>` to ensure you have all
the necessary library dependencies available. If you have already built WRF-Hydro,
you can skip to step "CMake Build", repeated here:

.. code-block::  bash

    $ cd project_directory/wrf_hydro_nwm_public  # project_directory/ from above
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DHYDRO_D=1 [-DWRF_HYDRO_NUDGING=1] ..   # include -DWRF_HYDRO_NUDGING=1 if you want to use the NWM test case
    $ make -j 4

The executables, namelists and tables will be created in the ``build/Run`` directory.

Running a WRF-Hydro Simulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section we will use our compiled WRF-Hydro model and an
example test case to run a WRF-Hydro simulation. This walkthrough is
using the Croton, NY example test case. After extracting the Croton tarball
details on the domain and time period of the simulation are provided in the
:file:`example_case/Readme.txt` file.

1. First we need to copy the TBL and executable files in the
   :file:`wrf_hydro_nwm_public*/src/build/Run`
   directory to the directory
   containing the domain and forcing files. For the WRF-Hydro Gridded
   configuration, these files are located in the directory
   :file:`example_case/Gridded`.

   Copy the :file:`*.TBL` files to the example configuration directory:

      | *(from your project directory)*
      | :code:`cp wrf_hydro_nwm_public*/build/Run/\*.TBL example_case/Gridded`

   Copy the :file:`wrf_hydro.exe` file:

      :code:`cp wrf_hydro_nwm_public*/build/Run/wrf_hydro.exe example_case/Gridded`

   .. note:: There are other configuration subfolders with the names such as :file:`Gridded`, :file:`nwm`, and
      :file:`Reach`. These folders contain prepared files for other configurations of WRF-Hydro. They are found
      under the :file:`src/template/` directory. Information
      regarding physics options and routing configurations can be found in the main body of the *WRF-Hydro*
      v\ |version_short| *Technical Description*. Also, note that there is only one :file:`FORCING/` directory.
      The same forcing data can be used for all configurations.

2. Next, we need to link our forcing data to the :file:`Gridded/` directory.

   From the :file:`example_case/Gridded directory`, create a symlink:

      :code:`ln -s ../FORCING .`

   Your project directory should now have the following
   directory structure and files:

   .. code-block:: console

      project_directory/
      ├──wrf_hydro_nwm_public/
      |      ├──src/
      |      ├──build/
      |
      ├──example_case/
               ├──Gridded/
                  ├──FORCING/
                  ├──DOMAIN/
                  ├──RESTART/
                  ├──referenceSim/
                  ├──CHANPARM.TBL
                  ├──GENPARM.TBL
                  ├──HYDRO.TBL
                  ├──MPTABLE.TBL
                  ├──SOILPARM.TBL
                  ├──hydro.namelist
                  ├──namelist.hydrodas
                  ├──wrf_hydro.exe

3. Now we will run the simulation. Note that there are many options
   and filepaths that need to be set in the two namelist files
   :file:`hydro.namelist` and :file:`namelist.hrldas`. However, for this
   walkthrough these files have been prepared for you.

   Before running the model, ensure you are in the :file:`example_case/Gridded`
   directory.

   We will now run the model using :command:`mpirun` with 2 cores. This command may
   differ depending on your system configuration, but here is an example
   of what this might look like:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mpirun -np 2 ./wrf_hydro.exe

4. If your simulation ran successfully, there should now be a large
   number of output files. Descriptions of the output files and their contents
   can be found in :ref:`Appendix A19 <section-a19>`. There are also two
   important files for determining the success or failure of the run,
   :file:`diag_hydro.00000` and :file:`diag_hydro.00001`. These :file:`diag_hydro`
   files contain logs and diagnostics on the simulation run, and one file is
   produced per core used in the run. Since we ran using 2 cores, we
   have 2 :file:`diag_hydro` files.

   You can check that your simulation ran successfully by examining the
   last line of the diag files, which should read:

   .. code-block:: console

      The model finished successfully........

   If this line is not present, the simulation did not finish
   successfully.

5. You can check the validity of your simulation results by comparing
   the restart files produced during your model run with the restart
   files included in the :file:`example_case/Gridded/referenceSim` directory.
   The restart files contain all the model states and thus provide a
   simple means for testing if two simulations produced the same
   results.

.. note:: Our current example test cases have only been run and tested with
   the Noah-MP land surface model. For information regarding running
   WRF-Hydro with Noah please see :ref:`Appendix A3 <section-a3>`.

A2. Coupled WRF | WRF-Hydro Test Case User Guide
------------------------------------------------

Purpose
^^^^^^^

This test case for the coupled WRF | WRF-Hydro modeling system is meant to
orient you to running the modeling system using prepared geographical inputs
for WRF-Hydro and sample initial and boundary conditions for WRF. Note that
some of the initial and boundary conditions for this test case have been
modified in order to produce a hydrologic response over a very limited spatial
domain. Results generated from this test case should not be interpreted as a
real simulation and users should consult the WRF and WPS documentation for
best practices with respect to domain and model configuration. The purpose of
this test case is to provide baseline instructions and a computationally
tractable test case for users to familiarize themselves with the modeling
system and help ensure the modeling system is running properly on their
systems. Please see the README.txt file provided with the test case for a more
detailed description of the contents.

Compiling the Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section will walk you through compiling the coupled WRF | WRF-Hydro
modeling system and the WRF Preprocessing System (WPS) utilities

**Compiling the coupled WRF | WRF-Hydro modeling system**

1. Navigate to the WRF source code directory at WRF*

.. code-block:: console

  cd WRF*

2. Remove the old WRF-Hydro source code contained within this directory and replace it
with the updated version you just downloaded

.. code-block:: console

  rm -r hydro
  cp -r ../wrf_hydro*/src hydro

3.  Load appropriate modules on Derecho:

.. code-block:: console

  module load ncarenv gcc ncarcompilers cray-mpich craype



4a. Configure WRF: CMake (preferred method)

.. code-block:: console

      cd …/WRF/
      # CMake option to turn on WRF-Hydro nudging `-DWRF_HYDRO_NUDGING=1`
      ./configure_new -x -p gfortran/gcc -- -DWRF_CORE=ARW -DWRF_NESTING=BASIC -DENABLE_HYDRO=ON -DWRF_CASE=EM_REAL
      ./compile_new


4b. Configure WRF: Old Method


.. code-block:: console

  # Load environement variables
  source WRF/hydro/template/setEnvar.sh

  # Export paths necessary for WRF to find the right libraries, follow the link
  # https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/compilation_tutorial.php#STEP2
  # under "Building Libraries" to build the appropriate WRF libraries

  export DIR=path/to/WRF/Build_WRF/LIBRARIES
  export NETCDF_INC=$DIR/netcdf/include
  export NETCDF_LIB=$DIR/netcdf/lib
  export CC="gcc"
  export CXX="g++"
  export FC="gfortran"
  export FCFLAGS="-m64"
  export F77="gfortran"
  export FFLAGS="-m64"
  export JASPERLIB=$DIR/grib2/lib
  export JASPERINC=$DIR/grib2/include
  export LDFLAGS=-L$DIR/grib2/lib
  setenv CPPFLAGS -I$DIR/grib2/include

  # Configure WRF
  # On Derecho, selection option 50 (Intel dmpar Cray XC) and 1 (basic nesting)
  cd …/WRF/
  ./configure
  ./compile >& compile.log





**Compiling the WRF Preprocessing System (WPS)**

Make sure that paths are set as in Step #5b from above

1. Navigate to the WPS source code directory at WPS*

2. Configure the WPS

.. code-block:: console

  ./configure_new

For Derecho select option 43: Cray XC CLE/Linux x86_64, Intel Classic compilers   (dmpar).

3. Compile the code and pipe the output to a log file.

.. code-block:: console

  ./compile_new >& compile.log

check the compile log for errors.


Running the WRF Preprocessing System (WPS)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section we will use the compiled WRF Preprocessing System (WPS)
utilities along with a namelist file ( namelist.wps ) and meteorological
forcing data from the coupled test case to generate geogrid and metgrid files
for the two model domains (note that the inner nest, or domain 2, is where
WRF-Hydro will run).

**Running the geogrid utility**

1. Create a run directory for WPS within your project directory

.. code-block:: console

  mkdir -p run/WPS
  cd run/WPS


2. Now copy the required files for the WPS geogrid utility into your run
   directory

.. code-block:: console

  cp ../../WPS*/install/bin/geogrid.exe .
  cp ../../WPS*/geogrid/GEOGRID.TBL .
  cp ../../example_case_coupled/namelist.wps .

Edit the paths within this namelist as appropriate for your system

3. Edit the path to geographic data in your ``namelist.wps`` file so that

.. code-block:: console

  geog_data_path = '/glade/work/wrfhelp/WPS_GEOG/',


4. Run the geogrid utility

.. code-block:: console

  ./geogrid.exe >& geogrid.log


**Running the ungrib utility**

The ungrib utility takes meteorological forcing data to be used for simulation
initial and boundary conditions and converts the files to an intermediate file
format used by the metgrid utility. Make sure modules are loaded from previous
steps.


1. Now copy the additional required files for the WPS ungrib utility into your
   run directory

.. code-block:: console

  cp ../../WPS*/install/bin/ungrib.exe .
  cp ../../WPS*/link_grib.csh .


2. Next copy over the necessary variable table for your forcing data

.. code-block:: console

  cp ../../WPS*/ungrib/Variable_Tables/Vtable.NAM Vtable

3. If the grib-util module is not loaded, make sure grib2 library is available

.. code-block:: console

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DIR/grib2/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


4. Then link your forcing data from the test case to the run directory (this
   script will also rename the files to those expected for the ungrib utility)

.. code-block:: console

  ./link_grib.csh ../../example_case_coupled/WRF_FORCING/*

5. Next run the ungrib utility

.. code-block:: console

  ./ungrib.exe >& ungrib.log


**Running the metgrid utility**

The metgrid utility does some interpolation of meteorological forcing data to
the model domain creating metgrid files to be used as input to the WRF real
utility.

1. Now copy additional the required files for the WPS metgrid utility into
   your run directory

.. code-block:: console

  cp ../../WPS/install/bin/metgrid.exe .
  cp ../../WPS/metgrid/METGRID.TBL .

2. Next run the metgrid utility

.. code-block:: console

  ./metgrid.exe >& metgrid.log


Running a coupled WRF | WRF-Hydro simulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section we will use our compiled coupled WRF | WRF-Hydro model to run
a simulation. This walkthrough uses the Front Range coupled example test
case. Details on the domain and time period of the simulation are provided in
the example_case_coupled/README.txt file.

**Setting up your run directory**

First we will create a run directory and copy over or link the required files.

1. Create a run directory for WRF by copying over the run directory from where
   it was compiled

.. code-block:: console

  cd project_directory
  mkdir run
  cp -RL WRF*/run run/WRF
  cd run/WRF


2. Copy over parameter tables for WRF-Hydro

.. code-block:: console

  cp ../../WRF/hydro/src/template/HYDRO/*TBL .
  cp ../../WRF/hydro/Land_models/NoahMP/run/*.TBL .

3. Copy over the namelists for real / wrf (namelist.input) and the hydro components
(hydro.namelist) from the example case

.. code-block:: console

  cp ../../example_case_coupled/namelist.input .
  cp ../../example_case_coupled/hydro.namelist .
  cp ../../WRF/hydro/template/NoahMP/namelist.hrldas .
  cp -r ../../example_case_coupled/DOMAIN/ .


4. Link the geogrid and metgrid files we just generated from the WPS utilities

.. code-block:: console

  ln -sf ../WPS/met_em* .
  ln -sf ../WPS/geo_em* .


4. Copy executable files

.. code-block:: console

  cp ../../WRF/install/bin/real .
  cp ../../WRF/install/bin/wrf .


**Running the real utility**

The WRF real utility creates the wrfinput* and wrfbdy* initial and boundary
condition files to be used as input for the coupled simulation.

1. Execute real using the proper syntax for your system (example below)
   and pipe the output to a log file.

.. code-block:: console

  mpirun -np 2 ./real >& real.log

2. Next review the rsl.out.* and rsl.error.* files for possible errors and
   check to make sure the wrfinput* and wrfbdy* files have been created.

**Running the coupled model**

Now we will run the coupled model (all included in the wrf binary) using
the wrfinput* and wrfbdy* files as initial and boundary conditions and the
model physics and other options selected in the namelist.input and
hydro.namelist files.

1. Execute wrf.exe using the proper syntax for your system (example below) and
   pipe the output to a log file.

.. code-block:: console

  mpirun -np 2 ./wrf >& wrf.log

2. If your simulation ran successfully, there should now be a large number of
   output files. Descriptions of the output files can be found in the
   WRF-Hydro V5 Technical Description at (
   https://ral.ucar.edu/projects/wrf_hydro ) and the WRF User’s Guide found
   here ( http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/docs/user_guide_v4/contents.html
   ). You will also want to review the rsl.out.* and rsl.error.* files for
   possible error messages.



.. _section-a3:

A3. Exceptions for Running WRF-Hydro with the Noah LSM
------------------------------------------------------

Support for the Noah Land Surface Model (LSM) within WRF-Hydro is
currently frozen at Noah version 3.6, development to use the
`refactored NoahMP <https://github.com/NCAR/noahmp>`_ as a submodule
is under way. Since the Noah LSM is not under
active development by the community, WRF-Hydro is continuing to support
Noah in deprecated mode only. Some new model features, such as the
improved output routines, have not been setup to be backward compatible
with Noah. Noah users should follow the guidelines below for adapting
the WRF-Hydro workflow to work with Noah:

-  **LSM initialization:** The simple wrfinput.nc initialization file
   created by the create_Wrfinput.R script does not currently include
   all of the fields required by the Noah LSM. Therefore, Noah users
   should use the WRF real.exe utility to create a wrfinput_d0x file.
   Refer to the WRF documentation and user guides for information on how
   to do this.

-  **Time-varying vegetation specifications:** While the Noah LSM will
   be properly initialized with green vegetation fraction from the
   wrfinput file, there is currently no automated method to update this
   field over time (e.g., seasonally based on climatology). Therefore,
   Noah users will need to provide these time-varying fields in the
   model input forcing files (e.g., LDASIN).

-  **Spatially varying parameters**: Spatially varying soil and
   vegetation parameters (e.g., soil_properties.nc) are not supported in
   Noah.

-  **Model outputs:** The updated output routines have not been adapted
   to work with Noah. Therefore, Noah users should always use
   io_form_outputs = 0 to activate the deprecated output routines.
   Scale/offset and compression options, CF compliance, augmented
   spatial metadata, etc. are not available in this deprecated mode.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Below is an annotated namelist.hrldas file for running with the Noah-MP
land surface model. Do note that the file says ``&NOAHLSM_OFFLINE``
however it is for use with the Noah-MP LSM. This namelist statement
happens to be hardcoded and thus not easily changed. Notes and
descriptions are indicated with <-- after sections
being described. See the official HRLDAS namelist description here:

A9. Noah-MP land surface model parameter tables
-----------------------------------------------

The Noah-MP land surface model requires three parameter table files
denoted by the file suffix TBL. The variables contained within these
files are described in the tables below.

As part of the work conducted for the National Water Model
implementation, the ability to specify a number of these land surface
model parameters spatially on a two or three dimensional grid was
introduced. This is done through the use of the compile time option
``SPATIAL_SOIL`` and the specification of a netCDF format parameter file
with the default filename soil_properties.nc. A list of the variables
contained in this file is included in a table below as well.

`GENPARM.TBL` This file contains global parameters for the Noah-MP
land surface model.

A15. Restart Files Overview
---------------------------

**Cold start versus warm start model simulations:**

When one start the model as a `cold start` (meaning that it is starting with the default values at the very
beginning), it takes time for the model to warm up and reach an equilibrium state. For example, consider
simulating streamflow values for a stream which has a base flow of at least 10 cms during the year, and you
have a `cold start`. The default values of the streamflow might be zeros at the start of the modeling. It then
takes time for the simulated streamflow within the model to reach the 10 cms. In contrast, a `warm start` is
when the model simulation begins with the simulated values of a given time step (starting time step) from a
previous run. This eliminates the processing time the model would take to reach an equilibrium state.
Depending on which variable of the model you are looking at, the time required to reach to the warm state may
differ. For example, groundwater requires a longer time period to reach to equilibrium.

**How to do a warm start simulations with WRF-Hydro?**

WRF-Hydro model outputs two set of model restart files (:file:`RESTART.YYYYmmddHH_DOMAIN` and
:file:`HYDRO_RST.YYYY-mm-dd_HH:MM_DOMAIN1`) which store the model states at a specified time and
could be used to start the model from that point in time. :file:`RESTART.YYYYmmddHH_DOMAIN` stores the
state variables reqiured for restarting LSM and :file:`HYDRO_RST.YYYY-mm-dd_HH:MM_DOMAIN`
stores the state variables required to resume the hydro components of the WRF-Hydro model.

To warm start the LSM part of the model, specify path to the restart file in the :file:`namelist.hrldas`
using `RESTART\_FILENAME\_REQUESTED` option.
To warm start the HYDRO part of the model, specify the path to the `HYDRO\_RST` file in
the :file:`hydro.namelist` using the option `RESTART\_FILE`, and also set the `gw\_restart` option to 1.
If the path to the files are left empty or commented out, it means the model simulation is cold started.


One could control the frequency of outputting restart files using the options `RESTART\_FREQUENCY\_HOURS`
and `rst\_dt` in the :file:`namelist.hrldas` and :file:`hydro.namelist`, respectively. If these options are set
to -9999, model outputs restart files once a month. Restart files are large in size, and therefore user
needs to be cautious of how frequently it outputs the restart files.

A17. National Water Model (NWM) Configuration
---------------------------------------------

The community WRF-Hydro modeling system is currently the underlying modeling
architecture for the NOAA National Water Model. This means that the community
WRF-Hydro model code is configurable into the National Water Model
configurations that run in operations at the National Center for
Environmental Prediction (NCEP).

.. pull-quote::

   “\ *The NWM is an hourly cycling uncoupled analysis and forecast system
   that provides streamflow for 2.7 million river reaches and other
   hydrologic information on 1km and 250m grids. The model provides
   complementary hydrologic guidance at current NWS River Forecast Center
   (RFC) river forecast locations and significantly expanded guidance
   coverage and type in underserved locations.*

   *The NWM ingests forcing from a variety of sources including Multi-Radar
   Multi-Sensor (MRMS) radar-gauge observed precipitation data and
   High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), Rapid Refresh (RAP), Global
   Forecast System (GFS) and Climate Forecast System (CFS) Numerical
   Weather Prediction (NWP) forecast data. USGS real-time streamflow
   observations are assimilated and all NWM configurations benefit from the
   inclusion of ~5500 reservoirs. The core of the NWM system is the
   National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)-supported community
   Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Hydro hydrologic model. WRF-Hydro
   is configured to use the Noah Multi-Parameterization (Noah-MP) Land Surface Model (LSM) to simulate land
   surface processes. Separate water routing modules perform diffusive wave
   surface routing and saturated subsurface flow routing on a 250m grid,
   and Muskingum-Cunge channel routing down NHDPlusV2 stream reaches. River
   analyses and forecasts are provided across a domain encompassing the
   continental U.S. and hydrologically-contributing areas, while land
   surface output is available on a larger domain that extends beyond the
   continental U.S. into Canada and Mexico (roughly from latitude 19N to
   58N). In addition, NWM forcing datasets are provided on this domain at a
   resolution of 1km.*\ ”

A18. The Crocus Glacier Model
-----------------------------

Crocus is an energy and mass transfer snowpack model, initially developed for
avalanche forecasting (*Brun et al., 1989, 1992*). The version that was
implemented into the French SURFEX model V8.0 (*Vionnet et al., 2012*) is being
used here. This version has several updates from older versions of Crocus, such
as the impacts of wind drift.

The Crocus snowpack model is a multilayered, physically based snow model that
explicitly calculates snow grain properties in each snow layer and how these
properties change over time. The grain properties of dendricity, sphericity and
size are prognosed in Crocus through metamorphism, compaction and impacts of
wind drift. Furthermore, the snow albedo is calculated based on the snow grain
properties from the top 3cm of the snowpack (*Vionnet et al., 2012*) and is
calculated in three spectral bands (0.3-0.8, 0.8-1.5 and 1.5-2.5 `\mu m`).
Impurities in aging snow are parameterized in the UV and visible spectral band
(0.3-0.8 `\mu m`) from the age of the snow, with a time constant of 60 days. See
*Vionnet et al. (2012)* for a detailed description of the albedo calculations.
The albedo over ice is constant in all spectral bands and is 0.38, 0.23 and
0.08 for the spectral bands 0.3-0.8, 0.8-1.5 and 1.5-2.5 `\mu m`. The sensible and
latent heat are parameterized with an effective roughness length over snow and
ice (see *Vionnet et al. (2012)* for further details).

In the Crocus model, it is possible to divide the snow into a user-defined
maximum numbers of dynamically evolving layers. As new snow is accumulated, a
new active layer is added. As different snow layers become similar (based upon
the number of user-set layers, the thickness of the snow layers and the snow
grain characteristics), these snow layers will merge into single snow layers.

The Crocus module is added to the Noah-MP land surface model in WRF-Hydro to
act as a glacier mass balance model (*Eidhammer et al. 2021*). Over designated
glacier grid points, the Crocus snow model represents both snow and ice, while
outside of the designated glacier grid points, the regular three-layer snow
model in Noah-MP is used. Since the current Crocus implementation in WRF-Hydro
only acts over designated glacier grid points, we follow *Gerbaux et al. (2005)*
and assume that the temperatures at the bottom of the glacier and the ground
below are both at `0^\circ C`. Note that we have not yet incorporated
fluxes between the glacier and the ground below; thus, there is a constant
temperature boundary condition.

Both Crocus and Noah-MP (for the non-glacier grid points) output runoff from
snowmelt (and precipitation). This runoff is provided to the terrain routing
models in WRF-Hydro.

Note that the implementation of Crocus as a glacier mass balance model does not
address glacier movement (i.e., plastic flow) nor lateral wind (re)distribution
of snow. However, there are two options for including impacts on the snow due
to wind. One of the options impacts the snow density during blowing snow events
(*Brun et al., 1997*). This option is important in polar environments (*Brun et
al., 1997*). The other option is the sublimation due to snow drift, which was
implemented by *Vionnet et al. (2012)* and which is in the Crocus version that
is used in this study.

As implemented, if the glacier completely melts over a user-defined glacier
grid point, the original Noah-MP module is used from this point on. Therefore,
as currently implemented, the glacier cannot grow horizontally in extent; it
can only decrease in extent, as no dynamic response of the ice mass is included
in the model. Over short model time periods, the lack of increase in glacier
extent might impact a few grid points at the edges of the glacier. However,
given the expected increase in temperature in the future, we do not expect that
limiting glacier horizontal growth will have a major impact over most studied
glaciers as most are likely to decrease in mass and extent.

.. rubric:: Running WRF-Hydro / Glacier

Below is a description on how to run with Crocus as a glacier model. There are
only a few namelist options that needs to be added in :file:`namelist.hrldas`:

.. code-block:: fortran

   &CROCUS_nlist
   crocus_opt = 1      ! 0 model is off, 1 model is on
   act_lev = 40        ! 1-50, 20-40 normal options
   /

The initialization file wrfinput needs two additional fields to be defined:

   |   ``glacier``
   |   ``glacier_thickness``

The field ``glacier`` should have the value of 1 over glacier gridpoints. The
``glacier`` field can be provided by the user, or the user can use the glacier
category from ``IVGTYP``.

Here is an example how to generate initial glacier fields for an “ideal”
simulation, with homogeneous glacier thickness layer. In this case,
``IVGTYP=24`` represents glaciers:

.. code-block:: bash

   ncap2 -O -s 'glacier=IVGTYP' wrfinput.nc wrfinput.nc
   ncap2 -O -s 'where(glacier!=24) glacier=0' wrfinput.nc wrfinput.nc
   ncap2 -O -s 'where(glacier==24) glacier=1' wrfinput.nc wrfinput.nc

To create a 300 m thick glacier:

.. code-block:: bash

   ncap2 -O -s 'glacier_thickness=glacier*300' wrfinput.nc wrfinput.nc

At initialization, it is assumed that the glacier consists of only ice, and the
density is that of pure ice (`900 \frac{kg}{m^3}`). Within the user-defined maximum
layers (``act_lev``) the glacier is initialized with all the layers having the same
assumed density and snow grain properties. As new snow accumulates during the
simulations, the layers representing the glacier will start to merge since all
layers contain the initialized ice.

.. note::
   Note on other WRF-Hydro outputs: The following outputs are informed
   from both Noah-MP and Crocus. Over glacier gridpoints, the outputs
   are informed from Crocus: ``ACCET``, ``ALBEDO``, ``SNOWEQV``, ``SNOWH``
   and ``ACSNOWM``.

   Currently there are no namelist options to change parameter values.
   Several important parameters that can be modified can be found in:
   :file:`src/Land_models/NoahMP/phys/surfex/modd_snow_par.F90`

   Surface runoff is assigned to ``FLOW_ICE`` when the top active layer at the
   specific grid point has a density of 850 kg/m3, while surface runoff is
   assigned to ``FLOW_SNOW`` when the top active layer has a density equal to
   or less than 850 kg/m3. The sum of ``FLOW_ICE`` and ``FLOW_SNOW`` is equal
   to ``PSNOWTHRUFAL``. Note that runoff from precipitation is included in
   surface runoff, thus ``FLOW_SNOW`` and ``FLOW_ICE`` cannot be used directly
   as indication if melt is from the ice part of the glacier or snow part of
   the glacier.
