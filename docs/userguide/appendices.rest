A2. Exceptions for Running WRF-Hydro with the Noah LSM
------------------------------------------------------

Support for the Noah Land Surface Model (LSM) within WRF-Hydro is
currently frozen at Noah version 3.6. Since the Noah LSM is not under
active development by the community, WRF-Hydro is continuing to support
Noah in deprecated mode only. Some new model features, such as the
improved output routines, have not been setup to be backward compatible
with Noah. Noah users should follow the guidelines below for adapting
the WRF-Hydro workflow to work with Noah:

-  **LSM initialization:** The simple wrfinput.nc initialization file
   created by the create_Wrfinput.R script does not currently include
   all of the fields required by the Noah LSM. Therefore, Noah users
   should use the WRF real.exe utility to create a wrfinput_d0x file.
   Refer to the WRF documentation and user guides for information on how
   to do this.

-  **Time-varying vegetation specifications:** While the Noah LSM will
   be properly initialized with green vegetation fraction from the
   wrfinput file, there is currently no automated method to update this
   field over time (e.g., seasonally based on climatology). Therefore,
   Noah users will need to provide these time-varying fields in the
   model input forcing files (e.g., LDASIN).

-  **Spatially varying parameters**: Spatially varying soil and
   vegetation parameters (e.g., soil_properties.nc) are not supported in
   Noah.

-  **Model outputs:** The updated output routines have not been adapted
   to work with Noah. Therefore, Noah users should always use
   io_form_outputs = 0 to activate the deprecated output routines.
   Scale/offset and compression options, CF compliance, augmented
   spatial metadata, etc. are not available in this deprecated mode.

A7. Noah-MP land surface model parameter tables
-----------------------------------------------

The Noah-MP land surface model requires three parameter table files
denoted by the file suffix TBL. The variables contained within these
files are described in the tables below.

As part of the work conducted for the National Water Model
implementation, the ability to specify a number of these land surface
model parameters spatially on a two or three dimensional grid was
introduced. This is done through the use of the compile time option
``SPATIAL_SOIL`` and the specification of a netCDF format parameter file
with the default filename soil_properties.nc. A list of the variables
contained in this file is included in a table below as well.

`GENPARM.TBL` This file contains global parameters for the Noah-MP
land surface model.

A15. National Water Model (NWM) Configuration
---------------------------------------------

It is important to note here that the community WRF-Hydro modeling
system is currently the actual underlying modeling architecture that is
used in the NOAA National Water Model. This means that the community
WRF-Hydro model code is configurable into the National Water Model
configurations that runs in operations at the National Center for
Environmental Prediction (NCEP).

.. pull-quote::

   “\ *The NWM is an hourly cycling uncoupled analysis and forecast system
   that provides streamflow for 2.7 million river reaches and other
   hydrologic information on 1km and 250m grids. The model provides
   complementary hydrologic guidance at current NWS River Forecast Center
   (RFC) river forecast locations and significantly expanded guidance
   coverage and type in underserved locations.*

   *The NWM ingests forcing from a variety of sources including Multi-Radar
   Multi-Sensor (MRMS) radar-gauge observed precipitation data and
   High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), Rapid Refresh (RAP), Global
   Forecast System (GFS) and Climate Forecast System (CFS) Numerical
   Weather Prediction (NWP) forecast data. USGS real-time streamflow
   observations are assimilated and all NWM configurations benefit from the
   inclusion of ~5500 reservoirs. The core of the NWM system is the
   National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)-supported community
   Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Hydro hydrologic model. WRF-Hydro
   is configured to use the Noah Multi-*

   *Parameterization (Noah-MP) Land Surface Model (LSM) to simulate land
   surface processes. Separate water routing modules perform diffusive wave
   surface routing and saturated subsurface flow routing on a 250m grid,
   and Muskingum-Cunge channel routing down NHDPlusV2 stream reaches. River
   analyses and forecasts are provided across a domain encompassing the
   continental U.S. and hydrologically-contributing areas, while land
   surface output is available on a larger domain that extends beyond the
   continental U.S. into Canada and Mexico (roughly from latitude 19N to
   58N). In addition, NWM forcing datasets are provided on this domain at a
   resolution of 1km.*\ ”

For more information regarding the operational configuration, input, and
output data of the National Water Model see the Office of Water
Prediction website: http://water.noaa.gov/about/nwm and the Open Commons
Consortium Environmental Data Commons website:

The NWM/WRF-Hydro modeling system suite of tools for data
preparation, evaluation, and calibration. is continually under
development and will be rolled out to the community as each tool becomes
finalized with supporting documentation for public usage. To be
notified when tools become available please subscribe to the WRF-Hydro
email list https://ral.ucar.edu/projects/wrf_hydro/subscribe.

The figures below illustrate the physics permutations available in the
WRF-Hydro framework and the Noah-MP land surface model as well as the
current National Water Model configuration as of March 2018, the
NWM ecosystem and suite of tools and sample NWM configuration
namelists.

There are different NWM configurations that run operationally. The full
list of the configurations and their specifics can be found at
https://water.noaa.gov/about/nwm. Below we provide the namelists for the
Standard Analysis configuration (self-cycling with 3-hour look-back,
used to initialize CONUS short- and medium-range forecasts) as the
sample namelists. Note that the name of the files are different from the
conventions used throughout this documentation and they match with the
name of the files in operation (A subset of the model parameter files
used by the operational implementation of the NWM is available on `NWM
website <http://www.nohrsc.noaa.gov/pub/staff/keicher/NWM_live/NWM_parameters/>`__).
The namelists for all the configurations are also being distributed with
the model code.

A16. The Crocus Glacier Model
-----------------------------

Crocus is an energy and mass transfer snowpack model, initially developed for
avalanche forecasting (*Brun et al., 1989, 1992*). The version that was
implemented into the French SURFEX model V8.0 (*Vionnet et al., 2012*) is being
used here. This version has several updates from older versions of Crocus, such
as the impacts of wind drift.

The Crocus snowpack model is a multilayered, physically based snow model that
explicitly calculates snow grain properties in each snow layer and how these
properties change over time. The grain properties of dendricity, sphericity and
size are prognosed in Crocus through metamorphism, compaction and impacts of
wind drift. Furthermore, the snow albedo is calculated based on the snow grain
properties from the top 3cm of the snowpack (*Vionnet et al., 2012*) and is
calculated in three spectral bands (0.3-0.8, 0.8-1.5 and 1.5-2.5 `\mu m`).
Impurities in aging snow are parameterized in the UV and visible spectral band
(0.3-0.8 `\mu m`) from the age of the snow, with a time constant of 60 days. See
*Vionnet et al. (2012)* for a detailed description of the albedo calculations.
The albedo over ice is constant in all spectral bands and is 0.38, 0.23 and
0.08 for the spectral bands 0.3-0.8, 0.8-1.5 and 1.5-2.5 `\mu m`. The sensible and
latent heat are parameterized with an effective roughness length over snow and
ice (see *Vionnet et al. (2012)* for further details).

In the Crocus model, it is possible to divide the snow into a user-defined
maximum numbers of dynamically evolving layers. As new snow is accumulated, a
new active layer is added. As different snow layers become similar (based upon
the number of user-set layers, the thickness of the snow layers and the snow
grain characteristics), these snow layers will merge into single snow layers.

The Crocus module is added to the Noah-MP land surface model in WRF-Hydro to
act as a glacier mass balance model (*Eidhammer et al. 2021*). Over designated
glacier grid points, the Crocus snow model represents both snow and ice, while
outside of the designated glacier grid points, the regular three-layer snow
model in Noah-MP is used. Since the current Crocus implementation in WRF-Hydro
only acts over designated glacier grid points, we follow *Gerbaux et al. (2005)*
and assume that the temperatures at the bottom of the glacier and the ground
below are both at `0^\circ C`. Note that we have not yet incorporated
fluxes between the glacier and the ground below; thus, there is a constant
temperature boundary condition.

Both Crocus and Noah-MP (for the non-glacier grid points) output runoff from
snowmelt (and precipitation). This runoff is provided to the terrain routing
models in WRF-Hydro.

Note that the implementation of Crocus as a glacier mass balance model does not
address glacier movement (i.e., plastic flow) nor lateral wind (re)distribution
of snow. However, there are two options for including impacts on the snow due
to wind. One of the options impacts the snow density during blowing snow events
(*Brun et al., 1997*). This option is important in polar environments (*Brun et
al., 1997*). The other option is the sublimation due to snow drift, which was
implemented by *Vionnet et al. (2012)* and which is in the Crocus version that
is used in this study.

As implemented, if the glacier completely melts over a user-defined glacier
grid point, the original Noah-MP module is used from this point on. Therefore,
as currently implemented, the glacier cannot grow horizontally in extent; it
can only decrease in extent, as no dynamic response of the ice mass is included
in the model. Over short model time periods, the lack of increase in glacier
extent might impact a few grid points at the edges of the glacier. However,
given the expected increase in temperature in the future, we do not expect that
limiting glacier horizontal growth will have a major impact over most studied
glaciers as most are likely to decrease in mass and extent.

.. rubric:: Running WRF-Hydro / Glacier

Below is a description on how to run with Crocus as a glacier model. There are
only a few namelist options that needs to be added in :file:`namelist.hrldas`:

.. code-block:: fortran

   &CROCUS_nlist
   crocus_opt = 1      ! 0 model is off, 1 model is on
   act_lev = 40        ! 1-50, 20-40 normal options
   /

The initialization file wrfinput needs two additional fields to be defined:

   |   ``glacier``
   |   ``glacier_thickness``

The field ``glacier`` should have the value of 1 over glacier gridpoints. The
``glacier`` field can be provided by the user, or the user can use the glacier
category from ``IVGTYP``.

Here is an example how to generate initial glacier fields for an “ideal”
simulation, with homogeneous glacier thickness layer. In this case,
``IVGTYP=24`` represents glaciers:

.. code-block:: bash

   ncap2 -O -s 'glacier=IVGTYP' wrfinput.nc wrfinput.nc
   ncap2 -O -s 'where(glacier!=24) glacier=0' wrfinput.nc wrfinput.nc
   ncap2 -O -s 'where(glacier==24) glacier=1' wrfinput.nc wrfinput.nc

To create a 300 m thick glacier:

.. code-block:: bash

   ncap2 -O -s 'glacier_thickness=glacier*300' wrfinput.nc wrfinput.nc

At initialization, it is assumed that the glacier consists of only ice, and the
density is that of pure ice (`900 \frac{kg}{m^3}`). Within the user-defined maximum
layers (``act_lev``) the glacier is initialized with all the layers having the same
assumed density and snow grain properties. As new snow accumulates during the
simulations, the layers representing the glacier will start to merge since all
layers contain the initialized ice.
