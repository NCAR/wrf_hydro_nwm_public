VariableName	Dimensions	Description	Units	Notes
TOPOGRAPHY	Routing grid	Terrain grid or Digital Elevation Model (DEM).	m
FLOWDIRECTION	Routing grid	Flow direction grid, which explicitly defines flow directions along the channel network in gridded routing. This variable dictates where water flows into channels from the land surface as well as in the channel.	categorical
FLOWACC	Routing grid	Number of upstream cells that drain into each cell.	count
CHANNELGRID	Routing grid	Channel network grid identifying the location of stream channel grid cells (-9999=no channel, -1=deactivated channel, 0=active channel)	categorical
STREAMORDER	Routing grid	Strahler stream order grid identifying the stream order for all channel pixels within the channel network.	categorical
LKSATFAC	Routing grid	Multiplier on saturated hydraulic conductivity in lateral flow direction.	dimensionless
RETDEPRTFAC	Routing grid	Multiplier on maximum retention depth before flow is routed as overland flow.	dimensionless
OVROUGHRTFAC	Routing grid	Multiplier on Manning's roughness for overland flow.	dimensionless
frxst_pts	Routing grid	Prescribed forecast points	index
basn_msk	Routing grid	Prescribed basin masks	index
LAKEGRID	Routing grid	Prescribed lakes	index
landuse	Routing grid	Land use from geogrid regridded to the high-res routing grid	categorical
