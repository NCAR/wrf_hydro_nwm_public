! This module is the base module for reservoirs that defines
! abstract types for a reservoir base, reservoir state, and
! reservoir properties. It also defines types for the inputs
! and outputs common to all sub-types of reservoirs. Finally,
! it defines a pointer to a reservoir object and an interface
! for running release on a reservoir.
module module_reservoir_base

    ! Defines the reservoir base state stuct that sub-types of
    ! reservoirs will derive from. Since this is abstract, an instance
    ! of reservoir state cannot be created but only derived to sub-types
    ! of reservoirs. State holds and tracks dynamic/changing variables
    ! that are only relevant to the given reservoir object and not other
    ! modules or areas of the system.
    type, abstract :: reservoir_base_state_struct

    end type

    ! Defines the reservoir base properties/parameters stuct that
    ! sub-types of reservoirs will derive from. Since this is abstract,
    ! an instance of reservoir properties cannot be created but only
    ! derived to sub-types of reservoirs. Properties holds
    ! static/unchanging variables that are set when the given reservoir
    ! object is initialized/instantiated.
    type, abstract :: reservoir_base_properties_struct

    end type

    ! Defines the input base stuct which holds the same inputs that all
    ! sub-types of reservoirs will derive from. Therefore, all types of
    ! reservoirs will hold the inputs defined below. These are
    ! dynamic/changing variables that will receive values passed into the
    ! object's methods/subroutines at runtime.

    contains

    end type

    ! Defines the output base stuct which holds the same output(s) that all
    ! sub-types of reservoirs will derive from. Therefore, all types of
    ! reservoirs will hold the output(s) defined below. These are
    ! dynamic/changing variables that will receive values returned from the
    ! object's methods/subroutines at runtime.

    ! cannot be created but only derived to sub-types of reservoirs.

    ! inputs, and outputs as sub-objects.
